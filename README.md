# Arduino library for LPD8806
### For tiny non-SPI micro-controllers.
This Library was written for the LPD8806 PWM LED driver chips, strips and pixels.
It was adapted to work with with tiny non-SPI micro controllers.
Apparently strips with LPD8803/LPD8809 chips may work too.

## Installation ##
1. Uncompress the Downloaded Library
2. Rename the uncompressed folder to Simple_LPD8806
3. Check that the Simple_LPD8806 folder contains Simple_LPD8806.cpp and Simple_LPD8806.h
4. Place the Simple_LPD8806 library folder your <arduinosketchfolder>/libraries/ folder, if the libraries folder does not exist - create it first!
5. Restart the IDE

## Example products
* An LED strip using LDP8806 on [Adafruit](http://www.adafruit.com/products/306)
* A tiny non-SPI mico-controller called [Trinket](http://www.adafruit.com/products/1501)
